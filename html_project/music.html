            <p>I love playing music and singing. I am currently working on two brand new albums.</p>
            <p>I grew up in a very musical household. My Mom Uncle and Grandfather were all musicians.</p>
            <p>My Dad had a huge influence on my musical taste, introducing me to classic rock and blues.</p>
            <p>I play acoustic and electric guitar, organ and piano. I love to play shows around the local area.</p>
